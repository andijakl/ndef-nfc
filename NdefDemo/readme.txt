Example app for the NDEF Library for Proximity APIs (NFC)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The NDEF Demo is an example app that demonstrates how to use the 
NDEF Library for Proximity APIs (NFC) in a Windows 10 (UWP), Windows 8.1 (WinRT) 
and Windows Phone 8 (Silverlight) app.


Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Proximity APIs for NFC (Near Field Communication) in the Windows 8 platform 
are compatible to NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format) messages, which are used on 
NFC tags and to send data between two devices.

While the Proximity APIs include basic support for URIs, they lack support for 
more in-depth control over the NDEF records, as well as additional standardized 
record types.

This NDEF Library provides a set of classes that enable you to easily work with 
NDEF records on top of the Windows Proximity APIs.

Integrate the library into your Windows (Phone) 8 project using the 
NuGet package manager of Visual Studio!
